- 12/21: Mentored a roundtable on causal inference at the 2021 Women in Machine Learning Workshop @ NeurIPS. 
- 5/21: It was fun to (virtually) chat with Smith College Intro ML students about starting out in ML and ML careers. 
- 12/20: My third year mentoring a roundtable on seeking funding: fellowships and grants at the Women in Machine Learning Workshop @ NeurIPS! 
- 4/19: Received the inaugural MA alum of the year award from Columbia's Statistics Department. Beyond honored!
- 1/19: I gave a talk at Microsoft Research during the AI residents' lunch seminar. It was really nice to meet the AI residents!
- 11/18: I will be giving a talk at AT&T Labs' Graduate Student Symposium.
- 10/18: I presented a poster at Microsoft Research's PhD Summit Workshop.
- 5/18: Back at UC Santa Cruz again to give guest lecture on interpretability.
- 4/18: I'm now affiliated with Cornell's [Algorithms, Big Data, and Inequality program](http://socialsciences.cornell.edu/algorithms/).
- 4/18: I visited Novartis Pharmaceuticals's Statistics Methodology Group for a week where I gave a talk, learned more about clinical trials, and had some very interesting brainstorming sessions around causal inference.
- 3/18: I am giving talks at UC Santa Cruz and [UCSF](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/events/two-projects-interpretability-and-causal-inference-auditing-black-box-modelsimpact-evaluation).
- 2/18: I will be giving an oral talk at [AIES 2018](http://www.aies-conference.com) and participating in the doctoral consortium.
- 1/18: Attending [BIRS Workshop on Machine Learning and Statistical Inference](http://www.birs.ca/events/2018/5-day-workshops/18w5054).
- 1/17: I presented a poster at Amazon's Graduate Research Symposium.
- 8/16: I'll be spending 6 months investigating dynamic topic models for long-term text corpuses thanks to a [Harmony Institute Research Fellowship](https://harmonylabs.org).
- 12/14: It was only months ago that I first learnt design thinking from a course in Cornell's MBA program. Then we spent spring break visiting the Stanford d.school and solving a design thinking challenge for Airbnb. Facilitating a design thinking workshop at Cornell wraps up this adventure. Read about the workshop [here](https://team42design.wordpress.com/").
- 10/14: The American Statistical Association interviewed me and other statistics fellows about [our experience in the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/10/01/dssg/). It was a great program, highly recommended if you are looking to explore the data for social good space.
- 7/14: I had great fun co-organizing (together with Sabina Tomkins) an "evil" hackathon for my fellow Data Science for Social Good fellows. Read about it [here](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2014/07/29/a-hackathon-for-but-mostly-against-evil).
