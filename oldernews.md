- 12/14: It was only months ago that I first learnt design thinking from a course in Cornell's MBA program. Then we spent spring break visiting the Stanford d.school and solving a design thinking challenge for Airbnb. Facilitating a design thinking workshop at Cornell wraps up this adventure. Read about the workshop [here](https://team42design.wordpress.com/").
- 10/14: The American Statistical Association interviewed me and other statistics fellows about [our experience in the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/10/01/dssg/). It was a great program, highly recommended if you are looking to explore the data for social good space.
- 7/14: I had great fun co-organizing (together with Sabina Tomkins) an "evil" hackathon for my fellow Data Science for Social Good fellows. Read about it [here](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2014/07/29/a-hackathon-for-but-mostly-against-evil).
