                <p>I am a research scientist at Facebook, working on safe and robust experimentation and causal inference. I am also interested in interpretability and algorithmic fairness. I received my PhD from <a href="https://stat.cornell.edu/">Cornell Statistics</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~hooker/">Giles Hooker</a> and <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mtw1/">Martin Wells</a>, with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/">Thorsten Joachims</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcaruana/">Rich Caruana</a> on my committee. I recently co-founded the <a href="https://www.trustworthyml.org/">Trustworthy ML Initiative</a>.</p> 
                
<p>Previously, I studied at Berkeley and Columbia, and worked in public policy in NYC, including the health department and public hospitals system. In 2014, I was a <a href="http://www.dssgfellowship.org/">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow. I spent two summers at Microsoft Research, working with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcaruana/">Rich Caruana</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kori/">Kori Inkpen</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/eckamar/">Ece Kamar</a>. During the later years of my PhD studies, I was based in the SF Bay Area where I was a visiting student and bioinformatics programmer at <a href="https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/">UCSF</a>. I am on the board of the <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org">Women in Machine Learning</a> organization.</p>

- 10/19: I gave a talk at Data & Society's Meeting on Fair ML in Health about risk scoring models in healthcare.
- 7/19: I had a blast helping out with [UCSF's AI4ALL program](http://ai4all.ucsf.edu/)! I presented on dataset bias and helped mentor a project team using electronic medical records to predict opioid overdose and other conditions. 
- 4/19: I will be giving a talk at Columbia's Data Science Institute in the [Data for Good seminar series](https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?href=/public/cals/MainCal/CAL-00bb9e24-69b3e39a-0169-b633b324-000010e3.ics).
- 3/19: I'm excited to help teach the new [ML for biomedicine course at UCSF](https://ticr.ucsf.edu/courses/machine_learning.html). This is perhaps the first official ML course at UCSF and I'm looking forward to teaching again!
