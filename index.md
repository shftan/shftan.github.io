<div class="container" id="about"><h3>About Me</h3>
I'm a PhD student at Cornell Statistics, minoring in Computer Science. I'm currently a visiting student at UCSF. Broadly, I work on interpretability of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in causal inference and algorithmic fairness. I'm advised by Giles Hooker and Martin Wells, and Thorsten Joachims is on my committee. Previously, I studied at Berkeley and Columbia, and worked in public policy in NYC, including the health department, public hospitals system, and a media nonprofit. In 2014, I was a Data Science for Social Good fellow. I spent summer 2015 at Xerox Research (now Naver Labs) and summers 2017 and 2018 at Microsoft Research, working with Rich Caruana. I'm on the board of the Women in Machine Learning organization.
