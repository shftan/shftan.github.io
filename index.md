                <p>I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://stat.cornell.edu/">Cornell Statistics</a>, minoring in Computer Science. I'm currently a visiting student at <a href="https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/">UCSF</a>. Broadly, I work on interpretability of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in causal inference and algorithmic fairness.</p>
                
                <p>I'm advised by <a href="http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~hooker/">Giles Hooker</a> and <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mtw1/">Martin Wells</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/">Thorsten Joachims</a> is on my committee. Previously, I studied at Berkeley and Columbia, and worked in public policy in NYC, including the health department, public hospitals system, and a media nonprofit. In 2014, I was a <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow. I spent summer 2015 at Xerox Research (now <a href="http://www.europe.naverlabs.com">Naver Labs</a>) and summers 2017 and 2018 at Microsoft Research, working with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcaruana/">Rich Caruana</a>. I'm on the board of the <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org">Women in Machine Learning</a> organization.</p>
