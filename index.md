<div class="row-fluid" id="about"><h3>About Me</h3>
</div>
I'm a PhD student at [Cornell Statistics](https://stat.cornell.edu/), minoring in Computer Science. I'm currently a visiting student at [UCSF](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/). Broadly, I work on interpretability of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in causal inference and algorithmic fairness.
