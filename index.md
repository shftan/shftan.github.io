    <div class="span11">
      I'm a PhD student at Cornell Statistics, minoring in Computer Science. I'm currently a visiting student at UCSF. Broadly, I work on interpretability of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in causal inference and algorithmic fairness. This website is under construction.
