    <div class="span11">
      I'm a PhD student at Cornell Statistics, minoring in Computer Science. I'm currently a visiting student at UCSF. Broadly, I work on interpretability of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in causal inference and algorithmic fairness. This website is under construction. For now, please see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_tSKmPYAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> or contact me at ht395 AT cornell.edu.
